We use Nuxt 3 for our application, with vue 3 composition and vuetify for styling.

Do not use, but prefer nuxt native functions: axios, auth-next

We are developing the following application a terms monitor for terms of use, privacy terms, user terms, etc for software applications, particularly for SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions, which should answer the concerns growing over privacy, compliance, and regulatory changes. Here's an overview of the concept and some potential components for such a tool:

## Key Goals of the Terms Monitor:
Track Changes in Terms & Conditions (T&Cs): SaaS companies often update their T&Cs, privacy policies, and user agreements. These updates can be frequent, especially as regulations change or new features are added. A terms monitor can help businesses and users keep track of these changes to ensure they are informed of new obligations or policies.

Alerting & Notifications: Businesses can set up automated alerts to notify them whenever there’s an update to the terms or privacy policy of a service they use. This ensures compliance and reduces the risk of missed changes that could affect the organization legally or operationally.

Compliance Management: Keeping track of changes to terms and conditions and ensuring that they align with current industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) is crucial for SaaS businesses. The monitor could assess whether the changes are legally compliant and flag discrepancies.

Version Comparison: A tool that highlights what’s different between two versions of T&Cs would be valuable. This allows businesses to quickly spot significant changes without having to compare the documents manually.

Centralized Repository: Instead of checking various SaaS platforms for changes, a terms monitor could aggregate all T&Cs from a business’s software stack, allowing for easier oversight. The repository could also store historical versions of the terms for audit purposes.

## Key Features of a Terms Monitor:
Automated Crawling & Detection: The tool can periodically crawl the websites of SaaS providers to detect if there’s been an update to the terms, privacy policies, or user agreements.

Version Tracking and Change Detection: The tool would track all versions of T&Cs, comparing the old and new versions and highlighting any changes. This could include text changes, additions, or deletions.

User-Friendly Dashboard: A dashboard to display notifications, changes, and updates at a glance. A SaaS business could quickly see which of their services has updated its terms, the frequency of updates, and the impact of these changes.

Integration with Document Management Systems: It can integrate with document management systems to keep a secure, easily accessible version history and to make sure the updated terms are distributed to relevant stakeholders in the organization.

Legal Risk Evaluation: A built-in tool that evaluates changes in terms and flags possible legal risks, such as clauses that may affect data handling or introduce new liabilities for the business or its users.

Notification System: Customizable alerts that can be sent via email or Slack when a new update happens. Businesses could choose the level of urgency for different types of changes.

Customizable Rules Engine: Users can set certain rules based on keywords, regulatory concerns, or terms that they want to be alerted about specifically. For example, users could set up alerts for terms related to payment policies or changes in data processing practices.

## Potential Benefits:
Legal Compliance: Ensures that organizations stay compliant with ever-changing regulations and avoid legal issues.
Operational Efficiency: Reduces manual monitoring time for updates, helping businesses save time and resources.

Risk Management: Identifies critical changes in terms that may introduce risks, allowing businesses to adjust operations or inform users accordingly.

Transparency: Provides better visibility of the T&Cs across various services, helping organizations make informed decisions.

## Potential Challenges:
Diverse T&Cs Formats: T&Cs come in many different formats across various SaaS providers, making it difficult to automatically compare or analyze them consistently.

Dynamic Legal Language: Legal language can be nuanced, so interpreting changes correctly can be a challenge.

Data Privacy Concerns: While monitoring terms for changes, it’s important not to compromise user privacy. The tool must handle sensitive information securely.

## Development Considerations:
Web Scraping: You'll likely need web scraping tools to extract T&Cs from SaaS websites. It’s crucial to ensure this is done in accordance with terms of service, especially as some sites may have anti-scraping policies.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use NLP techniques to detect changes in the text and automatically interpret legal language.

Cloud Integration: A SaaS-based tool would work best, leveraging cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability, accessibility, and integration with other software used by businesses.

## Target Audience:
SaaS Providers: They can use this tool to monitor their own terms and ensure they are updated in compliance with evolving regulations.

Enterprises Using Multiple SaaS Products: Organizations that rely on several SaaS applications will benefit from an aggregated overview of T&Cs changes across their entire software stack.

In conclusion, a terms monitor can significantly improve efficiency, legal compliance, and transparency in managing SaaS agreements. The challenge lies in building a tool that is adaptable, handles various formats, and can be accurate enough to track nuanced legal changes.
